 I shall be here in I cam, for whenever thou hast need of my services.

 Sure, can you help me change my class?

 As thou desire.

 Wait.

 Wait, I can't be speck her.

 Barbarian, I can make her a bard.

 Cleric, Druid.

 It doesn't change her appearance, but it can change her subclass, and then subclass probably.

 And that's pretty cheap.

 You can make her a sorcerer.

 Probably do.

 But this is pretty cool.

 Level up.

 Fighter, level two.

 Nice.
